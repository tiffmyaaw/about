# ðŸŒŸ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
Hi, I'm Tiffany. I'm a Growth Hacker at Holdex.

## ðŸ’¼ What I Do & What I Love About Holdex
- I joined Holdex in February 2025 after nearly a decade working across the game industry and other diverse sectors.
- As a contributor at Holdex, we all work remotely as a globally distributed team. For me, this is both a challenge and a privilege. I get to enjoy a few hours earlier before working, while our team is usually become more active around noon in my timezone. Being focused at night has almost become my new routine.
- Even with my current role, that doesn't limit what I can do to leverage Holdex in several other aspects. Aside from doing marketing and managing social media, I also help with HR tasks and other unexpected matters.
- While working here, I'm always excited to take part in different aspects of various projects. Every experience helps me discover new sides of Web3 that I haven't explored before.
